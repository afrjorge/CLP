This plugin lists the contents of a folder in the Pentaho Repository (accessible via the Pentaho User Console),
allowing for the selection and display of these contents.

By default, this plugin loads the contents of the BI Developer Example (SteelWheels reports).
This plugin's default configuration is set in the plugin's clp.xml file. This configuration can be overridden by 
placing a customized version of this file in /public/clp/clp.xml, using the Pentaho User Console
